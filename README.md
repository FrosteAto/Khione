Khione is a custom Arch Linux distro built around a practical, opinionated setup for desktop, server, and appliance use.

There are three editions to choose:

- Desktop Edition
- Server Edition
- Node Edition

</p>

Khione Desktop is a full daily-driver environment with programming, productivity, gaming, and creative tools already installed.

</p>

Khione Server is a lean profile tuned for long-running services, including Plex defaults and enough local tooling to debug directly on the machine.

Khione Node is a minimal profile whose only job is to boot, log in, and show a dashboard in Firefox.

<h2 align="center">Installation Guide</h2>

The Khione install flow is mostly automated, while keeping the key Archinstall choices in your hands.

## Before you begin

- Use a stable internet connection during install.
- Decide which ISO you want:
  - Desktop Edition: full daily-driver setup.
  - Server Edition: lightweight setup with server defaults.
  - Node Edition: minimal setup with just the base system and Firefox.

## Step 1: Download the ISO

Download the Desktop, Server, or Node ISO from the Releases page.

Optional but recommended checksum verification:

```bash
sha256sum <your-iso-file>.iso
```

## Step 2: Write the ISO to a USB

Use USBImager, Balena Etcher, or Rufus.

If you are on Linux and want to use `dd`:

```bash
sudo dd if=<your-iso-file>.iso of=/dev/<usb-device> bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
```

## Step 3: Boot from the USB

- Boot the target machine from the USB.
- Select the Khione install option in the boot menu.
- The installer launcher should auto-start on tty1.

If it does not auto-start, run it manually:

```bash
/root/start-install.sh
```

## Step 4: Complete Archinstall base configuration

In Archinstall, configure the basics:

- Mirror region
- Disk layout and mount points
- User account(s) and passwords
- Timezone and locale

Then let Archinstall complete the base system installation.

## Step 5: Let Khione finish setup

After Archinstall finishes, Khione continues automatically and applies packages, services, and system configuration.

Install output is logged to:

```bash
/var/log/khione/install-<timestamp>.log
```

## Step 6: Reboot into Khione

Once setup fully completes:

- Reboot
- Remove the USB when prompted
- Log into your new system

## Step 7: Quick post-install checks

- Confirm networking is up
- Run updates

```bash
yay
```

For troubleshooting logs:

```bash
cat /var/log/archinstall/install.log
ls -1 /var/log/khione/
```

## Step 8: Success!

Khione is now installed and ready to use, tweak, and build on.

<h2 align="center">Music Production Support</h2>

Linux and music production have historically not gotten along, especially in the PulseAudio days. DAW support isn't great and wine tends to fight back. Khione includes a dedicated setup script that handles the fiddly bits for you.

## FL Studio + Hatsune Miku

`fl-miku-setup` creates a dedicated Wine prefix pre-configured for FL Studio and the Crypton Piapro Studio voicebank suite, including Japanese locale and font setup so the installers actually render correctly.

**Supported:**
- FL Studio 25
- Piapro Studio VST
- Hatsune Miku V4X voicebank
- Hatsune Miku V4 English voicebank

> **Note:** Hatsune Miku V6 / Vocaloid 6 is currently broken on Linux under Wine and, whilst optionally included, will not properly work.

## Setup

Download your installers and put them in the right place:

- The script will download FL Studio automatically.
- Place your SonicWire Miku V4X zip anywhere inside `~/Installers/Audio/MikuV4X/`.

Then search for `FL Miku Setup` in KRunner, or run it from a terminal:

```bash
fl-miku-setup
```

It will walk you through everything interactively. You can re-run it at any time to install individual components, regenerate launchers, or activate voicebank licences.

## After setup

The following entries will appear in KRunner:

- `FL Studio` — launch the DAW
- `FL Miku Wine Config` — open winecfg for the fl-miku prefix
- `Kill FL Miku Wine` — stop the Wine server

<h2 align="center">FAQ</h2>


## Why not use a headless server?

- No modern hardware has a meaningful loss from having something like plasma running in the background
  - Miku :)
- Sometimes it's easier to debug on-device and this is running on a spare laptop
  - Miku :D
- I can still SSH in
  - Miku :3
- I wanted an excuse to rice Arch again
  - Miku :0
- I have a staggering skill issue

## How do I use my programs?

Pressing alt + space will open KRunner, which you can use to type in any program name or category and it will appear.

## How do I update my programs?

Just type yay into the terminal, it will find and update everything for you. Very handy.

## How do I get new programs?

Google "*program you need or problem to solve* Arch" and and it will probably appear. If it's part of the main Arch repos you can do 

```
sudo pacman -S *packageName*
```
and if it's part of the AUR you can do
```
yay -S *packageName*
```
to install it.

<h2 align="center">AI Usage Disclaimer</h2>

Yeah I used AI to assist in writing the code. Look at this repo, it sucks. But I program from 9-5 without it, so let me enjoy things in my downtime. Also debugging wine prefixes is the most boring thing ever.
