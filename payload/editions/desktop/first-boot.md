## Music Workflow

You can now easily produce music on Khione! Simply download the relevant windows installlers, place them in the correct folder, and watch as it automatically creates a new wine prefix with perfect compatibility for `FL Studio`, `Piapro Studio` and `Hatsune Miku V4X`!

Messing around has never been easier.
